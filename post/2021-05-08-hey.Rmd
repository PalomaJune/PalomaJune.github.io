All of this is quite neat, I'm having a lot of fun!

I've taken a couple classes in Python, and I've taken a couple of classes in R, but I didn't know you could get them to work together!


Here is some code in R:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
this <- "We can"
```


Here is some code in Python:
```{python}
that = "print stuff like this"
print(r.this,that)
```
How neat is that!
I love that we can do stuff like this!

Here's the image I always use as finals inspo. I don't know why it works, but telling Baby Yoda you are going to work hard is great inspiration to actually work hard!
